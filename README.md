# ready-to-eat
In this project we created a website to order food from the college cafeteria.

First, we developed the front end using React.js. Then we used Node.js for data modeling and Redux for state management. We used MongoDB as the database for our project and put all the data into it. Using Redux, we made corresponding services and controllers for products, product details, users, and admins. This completed the UI. 
After this, we worked on the admin side: how admin can manage new or existing products, a user, order details, etc. Then we made a full checkout page with several ways to pay, and we put the project online using Heroku, which is a cloud application platform.
